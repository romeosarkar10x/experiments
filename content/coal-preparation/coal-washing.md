# 4 Basic unit operations of a coal washing plant

## Comminution (Size reduction)

Breaking of raw coal.

$$ \text{Degree of liberation} = \frac{\text{Number of appearence of free grains}}{\text{Number of free grains} + \text{Number of locked particles}} \times 100 $$

Degree of liberation cutoff ($> 80\%$).

### Purpose of communtion:

- Liberate the particles
- Ease of handling
- Prepare the material of desired size of the end users.

### Devices used for comminution

1. Rotary Breaker (Slow speed)
2. Roll Crushers (Slow speed)
3. Hammer Mills (High speed)
4. Ring Granulators (High speed)

$$ \text{Reduction size} = \frac{\text{Feed size}}{\text{Product size}} $$

### Rotary Breakers

## Size separation

Classify the particles into different sizes.

## Benefication

1. Coarse coal (> 0.5mm)
2. Fine coal (< 0.5mm)

## Dewatering
